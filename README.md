I'm Gemmy Nguyen in the data world and Darea Rem when I write under moonlight.

### 🧬 Who I Am

```python
class Me:
    def __init__(self):
        self.curiosity = ∞
        self.origin = "market research"
        self.skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Power BI", "storytelling"]
        self.side_quests = ["music theory", "drawing", "writing stories"]
        self.project = "Blink"
        self.spirit_animal = "quiet rebel with a data pipeline"
```
🧠 Data explorer. 🎨 Storyteller. 🤖 Automator.
I build things that solve problems quietly, with clean lines and curious logic.
Currently designing Blink, a system to convert messy fieldwork files into meaningful, automated dashboards.

### 🛠️ Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Blink]| A fully automated data pipeline that transforms .dat, .o, and .var files into clean, structured formats for Power BI dashboards. Because chaos deserves clean design. |
| [Coming Soon] | Because ideas are never asleep. 🛌✨ |
